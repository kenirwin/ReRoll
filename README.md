# ReRoll

**ReRoll** offers a way of rolling dice in repeatable sequences. This tool is useful if you need a series of dice rolls and want to be able to repeat the exact sequence of rolls again. Each sequence is associated with a "seed"; by requesting the seed (aka "game number"), you can retrieve the sequence of rolls again.

Example of use: Backgammon is played with a sequence of dice rolls. This program will allow you and a partner to play a game with the same rolls more than once. For instance, you might wish to play a game, and then swap starting positions and play the same set of rolls again.

## Methodlogy

The rolls are generated by using the seed number to choose a position in *pi* and returning every third digit with a value between 1-6. This is not a truly random sequence.
